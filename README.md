## Process of making the game
The most difficult task for me was deciding between what to run in the player class's turn and what to run in the game class's run. There wre definetly advantages to programming finding the ship, captain, and crew within the player class instead of the game class in order to make my extension work. With players simultaneously playing, it made it possible for me to add the extension of players stealing from each other. Another difficulty I found was setting how many dice players got for each scenario, escpecially when players could start stealling from each other. I tried to cover all the errors that may occur within my extension for special scenarios, and that was pretty hard in my opinion. 

## My favourite Part of the program
My favourite part was programming the original game of just finding the ship, captain, and crew because it was fairly simple. I really hope the marker of this program goes easy on my extension because I personally really like it, but I could see how someone might take some more time to understand it. 

## How to run the program
The game consists of two players. Each player rolls 5 dice and tries to collect a ship, captain, and crew in 5 rolls. To get a ship, roll a 6, to get a captain, roll a 5, to roll a crew, roll a 4. You cannot roll a captain without a ship, and you cannot roll a crew without a ship and captain. You can roll two or all three in one roll though.  After ship, captain, and crew are found, players may use remaining two dice to roll for loot. Loot is just what number you roll added up in the two dice. After that, remaining rolls will give you an option to reroll for better loot. 


## how the extension works
Players may roll doubles to steal the opponets ship, captain, or crew. This means all throughout the game there is no clear winner until both players roll five times.


If for example player 1 rolls a ship then player 2 rolls doubles, player 2 can steal player ones ship and player 1 would have five dice again to try and roll a ship on their next play. If player 1 losses their ship, they will have 5 dice again to roll for a ship(if they lose their captain, they will have 4 dice to roll another captain assuming they still have an unstolen ship. If they lose their crew, they will have three dice to roll for the crew again.)

The most a player can have is one ship, one captain, and one crew. If player 1 already has a ship, they can take away the ship from player two but they still only have one ship that may be stolen in the next roll. Players will steal opponents most recent find whether that be a ship, captain, crew and even loot! 

Remaining turns may be used for rerolling the last two dice for a chance at a higher score!
